# About this Repo

### Welcome!

This repo contains the result of my projects from the book [**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

It is strictly created for my personal journey and records and do not intend to serve as an official answer for any of the projects in the book.

However please feel free to use it as a reference for our own learning in case needed.
